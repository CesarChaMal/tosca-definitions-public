# Generated Implementation Artifact Skeleton

* Interface Name: org_opentosca_nodetypes_Java_Shop_Application__org_opentosca_interfaces_database
* Namespace: http://nodetypeimplementations.opentosca.org/
* Java Package: org.opentosca.nodetypeimplementations
* URL: http://localhost:8080/winery/artifacttemplates/http%253A%252F%252Fopentosca.org%252Fartifacttemplates/Java_Shop_Application_DA/files/../

## Preconditions
To develop and build this Implementation Artifact you need Maven and Eclipse.
- How to install maven is described at the end of this file
- If you use an Eclipse workspace for the first time with a maven project you've to run this command before starting eclipse:
  `mvn -Declipse.workspace="<your_workspace_location>" eclipse:configure-workspace`
  - When using Windows: Make sure you replace `\` (backslashes) with `/` (slashes)
  - It does not hurt to run it multiple times
  - This command must not be executed in a particular folder

## Preparations
- Unzip the archive generated by Winery into a location of your choice.
- Note: All following maven commands are executed on a shell in the root folder of the Implementation Artifact.

## Test your Implementation Artifact
- Run `mvn clean package tomcat7:run-war`
 (more information: http://tomcat.apache.org/maven-plugin-trunk/tomcat7-maven-plugin/plugin-info.html)
- Open this page to see the list of available services: http://localhost:9090/services/
- This page also links the WSDL
- With the WSDL you are able to test your IA using SOAPui or other tools.

### Upload your Implementation Artifact
You have two options to do this:

#### 1) Automatically (to the Winery instance this IA project was generated with)
- Run `mvn deploy`
- The WAR is directly uploaded into the correct ArtifactTemplate. Previous versions are overwritten.

#### 2) Manually
- Run `mvn clean package`
- Locate the WAR file in the /target folder
- Open Winery in your browser, locate the NodeType and then click through to the Implementation of the respective Interface, its Implementation Artifacts and lastly to the ArtifactTemplate representing this IA.
- Upload the WAR file by clicking on the "Attach file..." button
